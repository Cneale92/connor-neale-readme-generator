# Connor-Neale-Readme-Generator

## Description

This project is a README generator application using the Node.JS command line interface inquirer.This application was built as a better way to create a README.md file for a project. By using this application, the user does not need to manually enter in the details for their project's README which reduces the chances of creating a bad README file to describe their project.

## Usage

To use this application, you'll need to firstly, clone the repository and run the project locally.
Once cloned, you will need to navigate to the project's folder in your terminal and run the command 'npm i' to install the necessary dependencies. 
Once the installation has completed, enter the command 'node index.js' to run the application. 
Once all prompts are answered, a new README.md file should be generated in your project file. 
If a new Readme file is generated, it will overwrite an exisiting Readme file.
